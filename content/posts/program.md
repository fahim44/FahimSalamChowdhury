## Program

A ***Computer Program*** is a sequence of instructions in a *programing language* which can a computer system can execute or interpret.

When we engineer/programmer/developer write any program in any programing language of our choice, we actually write in very human-readable language.
This is called source code.
We can understand whan source code is saying; but the computer only knows binary, & it can only execute programs which is in machine instructions (writter in binary).

There are mainly two types of programming language, low-level & high-level programming language.

### Low level programming language

Low level programming languages are which are very close to machine language & easily can convert its intructions to machine intructions.
Thus low level languages works fast & hard for us to get our head around to understand perfectly.
Assembly is a prime example of low level language.

### High level programming language

High level languages are just opposit.
High level languages are very human-readable, but their source code is not very much readable for the computer itself.
High level programs thats why need help of special programs, for example `compiler` which converts its source code to a low level language; or `interpreter` which directly convert to machine instructions.
Java, Python, all new progamming languages are example of high level languages.

### Executable

When source code is converted to machine instructions & saved into a file in the hard drive, the file is called **executable**.
When execution is requested, the executable file is loaded on the *memory* by the *operating system* & start the *process*.
The cpu then allocates cpu-time to this process & start executing the machine instructions.
