E-commerce service is the new hot trend. 
People love to shop online. 
Again, the pendemic lockdown takes the e-commerce businesses to another level. 
Rumor has, Amazon has ~35 orders per seconds! 
When you place an order in Amazon, you are given an 19 digit order number in split of seconds. 
This number is used to indentify the order, track the order, deliver the order etc. 
So besically, this number is very important. 
It also should be unique; because you don't want to mismatch your order with another person's order, right?
Have you ever wonder, how the big companies like **Amazon** & **Daraaz** generate this numbers? 
I don't know exactly, they don't share this because of security purpose. 
But we can assume the generation process.
Today we will discuss some of these process.
